#### Introduction

The prediction of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in whole slide digital images of squamous epithelium is a crucial task in histopathology. Recent advancements in deep learning models have shown promising results in this area. This review aims to summarize the state-of-the-art and high-performance models published in 2023 or 2024, focusing on the key components of the workflow, including preprocessing, deep learning model architecture and training, IHC staining prediction, and visualization.

#### Preprocessing of Whole Slide Images

1. **Handling Large Image Files**:
   - Techniques such as tile extraction and patch generation are used to handle large image files efficiently[1][3].
   - Data augmentation strategies like random cropping, flipping, and rotation are applied to increase the size of the training dataset[4].

2. **Color Normalization and Stain Separation**:
   - Color normalization techniques like histogram equalization and contrast stretching are used to enhance the visibility of the H&E staining[1][3].
   - Stain separation methods like the color deconvolution algorithm are applied to separate the hematoxylin and eosin components[1][3].

3. **Tile Extraction and Patch Generation**:
   - Tiles or patches are extracted from the whole slide images to create a dataset suitable for deep learning models[1][3].
   - The size and overlap of the patches are adjusted to balance the trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy[4].

4. **Data Augmentation Strategies**:
   - Data augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation are applied to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model robustness[4].

#### Deep Learning Model Architecture and Training

ViT, vision transformer


1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architectures**:
   - CNN architectures like ResNet, U-Net, and EfficientNet are used for their ability to learn hierarchical features and capture spatial relationships[1][3][4].

2. **Transfer Learning Approaches**:
   - Pre-trained models are fine-tuned on the specific task of IHC staining prediction to leverage the knowledge gained from larger datasets[1][3][4].

3. **Loss Functions and Optimization Algorithms**:
   - Common loss functions used include mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), while optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam are employed[1][3][4].

4. **Training Hyperparameters and Validation Strategies**:
   - Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are tuned to optimize model performance[1][3][4].
   - Validation strategies like cross-validation and holdout sets are used to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting[1][3][4].

5. **Hardware Requirements and Utilization of GPU Acceleration**:
   - The models are trained on high-performance computing systems with GPU acceleration to speed up the training process[1][3][4].

#### IHC Staining Prediction

1. **Methods for Applying Trained Models to New H&E Images**:
   - The trained models are applied to new H&E images to predict the corresponding IHC staining patterns[1][3][4].

2. **Techniques for Handling Whole Slide Image Inference**:
   - Techniques like tile-based inference and patch-based inference are used to handle the large size of whole slide images[1][3][4].

3. **Post-processing and Visualization of Predicted IHC Staining**:
   - The predicted IHC staining is post-processed to enhance the visibility and accuracy of the results[1][3][4].
   - Visualizations like heatmaps and overlays are used to display the predicted IHC staining overlaid on the H&E images[1][3][4].

4. **Evaluation Metrics and Performance Assessment**:
   - Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the models[1][3][4].
